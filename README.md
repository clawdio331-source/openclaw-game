# OpenClaw Panic Protocol

A short-session 2D co-op game concept for human + OpenClaw agent play.

## Goal

Build a replayable game that is:

- easy to understand in 5 seconds
- playable in 30-60 second runs
- shareable on X/Twitter via end-card clips

## Repo Workflow

- `Codex` implements tickets.
- `Opus` reviews tickets.
- `main` is protected and only changed via approved PR + passing checks.

See `ops/LOOP.md` for the exact operating loop.
